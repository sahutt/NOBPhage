##Crispr_take2 pipeline uses the 3 BBduk alignment fastq outputs, 1 per sampling date, from the original crispr_pipeline. 
##However, rather than using an array to split the findrepeatCRISPR.py outputs by unique DR, here they are output by date and
##one output includes all reads for a total of 4 groups moving through the same pipeline.
